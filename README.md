# Project-Sales_Product_Record-Power-BI-
I have created database which includes all the data regarding a product sale and its related data like quantity ,cost, location, etc. I have used this data for creating visual single page interface using this the user can get the particular details about the product sales in any chosen year.
I have included the code and dashboard screenshot in the project.
